# Context Theme

## Update
This plugin is no longer necessary as of 2020.3 EAP, the IDE will automatically sync its theme with the operating system.

This plugin only works with Windows 10. It syncs the IDE's theme with the Windows color scheme specified in the Personalization section of Settings.

This behaviour is already in-tree in IntelliJ community under the name "Sync with OS theme", and will likely be included in 2020.3

This plugin will act as a polyfill until that version release.
